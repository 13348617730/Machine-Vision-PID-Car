In the realm of contemporary military and security, the advent of unmanned systems performing tasks marks a significant trend, with the research into autonomous shooting vehicle technology emerging as a crucial endeavor. The objective here is to create an autonomous shooting vehicle that boasts superior performance through the integration of cutting-edge machine vision systems and adaptable PID control strategies. The vehicle is designed to dramatically enhance operational efficiency, safety, and shooting accuracy in complex and varying environments.
This study utilized a blend of experimental and simulation testing to comprehensively design and optimize key technologies for autonomous shooting vehicles, including navigation, target recognition, and shooting control systems. The results indicated a notable enhancement in the vehicle's accuracy in target detection, response speed of the system, and overall stability. Particularly, the machine vision system, equipped with high-precision target recognition algorithms, allows the vehicle to quickly and accurately lock onto and track targets, maintaining efficient operation even in highly complex environments.
The introduction of adaptive PID control methods has provided the shooting control system with greater flexibility and adaptability. This means that the vehicle can automatically adjust shooting parameters based on different environmental conditions and target characteristics, achieving optimal shooting outcomes. The fusion of these technologies not only elevates the performance of the autonomous shooting vehicle but also significantly broadens its application scenarios.
This research underscores the importance of combining machine vision and adaptive control technologies to enhance the performance of autonomous shooting vehicles. It demonstrates the potential of these technologies to improve operational efficiency and accuracy on the battlefield, offering valuable insights and inspiration for the future development and application of military technologies.
